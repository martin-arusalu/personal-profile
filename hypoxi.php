            <h5>Client: AS Spin TEK</h5>
            <p>A web development company AS Spin TEK hired me to redesign the HYPOXI Estonia webpage.
              My responsibility was creating the design prototypes and producing HTML + CSS + JS code 
              that is compliant with Spin TEK-s own CMS "Abiks".</p>
            <p>The page had to be compatible with phones, tablets and desktops, it had to be fast and 
              it had to follow International HYPOXI brand design guidelines. The new design is handed 
              over to the client but not yet implemented.</p>
