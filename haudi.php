            <h5>Client: AS Spin TEK</h5>
            <p>Haudi Information system and it's public portal is one of the biggest Estonian online environments. 
              My job was to refresh the design of Haudi itself (only CSS) and completely redesign the public portal.
              That meant completely new client side but also a lot of changes in the backend of the portal.</p>
            <p>When considering user experience design, I had to take into account that most of the users are above the 
              age of 50 and using older browsers. Also instead of staying with the old long list of all Estonian municipalities 
              I created a map for navigation.
